"Positive values (of deviation) indicate that the bus is running late while negative ones are for buses running ahead of schedule."

So if the change is negative, this means the bus became *more ahead of schedule / less behind schedule." If the change is positive
this means the bus became "less ahead of schedule/ more behind schedule". 
...TL;DR change < 0 means good, change > 0 means bad
